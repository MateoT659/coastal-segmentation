## Usage

1. Modify any configuration variables in `config.py`
2. Save and run `config.py` to determine if the variables are valid.
3. Then, run `data.ipynb` to generate a new dataset.
4. Finally, run one of the ipynb files in the `models` folder to train a model.

For more detail and configuration options, please visit `config.py` and explore `data.ipynb` and the `models` folder.
